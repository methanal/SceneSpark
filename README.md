## Introduction

SceneSpark is a tool designed to automate the extraction and generation of key scenes from videos. It leverages advanced algorithms to create impactful and concise highlights, making it easier to share and review important moments in any video.

## Features

- ðŸ”œ **Subtitle Clipper**: Extracts key scenes based on subtitle analysis.
- ðŸš§ **(Coming Soon) LLM CV Clipper**: Uses large language models for computer vision-based clipping.
- ðŸš§ **(Coming Soon) OCR Clipper**: Extracts scenes based on text recognition from video frames.
- ðŸš§ **(Coming Soon) RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhanced scene extraction.
- ðŸš§ **(Coming Soon) Microservices Architecture**: Frontend and backend services are decoupled and deployed using Docker Compose for seamless integration and scalability.
- ðŸš§ (Coming Soon) On-Premise Deployment: Easily deploy on your own physical servers or data centers for enhanced security and privacy.
